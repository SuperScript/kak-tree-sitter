# Shell completions

Both `kak-tree-sitter` and `ktsctl` ship with completions for some shells. This
document lists supported shells and how to install the completions — if that’s
not already handled by your package manager.

## Nushell

Completions are located [here](../../completions/kak-tree-sitter.nu). You should
source that file in your `config.nu`. For instance:

```nu
source <kak-tree-sitter-repo>/docs/completions/kak-tree-sitter.nu
```
