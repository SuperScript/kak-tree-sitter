# ktsctl

`ktsctl` is the CLI controller for `kak-tree-sitter`. It provides features such as downloading, compiling / linking and
installing grammars and queries. It is _optional_ but highly recommended.

You can configure it via the [configuration file](configuration.md).

## Commands

> Prerequisites:
>
> - The `cc` compiler, which should default to `gcc` on Linux for instance.
> - `git`, to download resources.
> - Some tree-sitter grammars require C++, so you will need to have the `libstd++` library installed.

Usage: `ktsctl <COMMAND>`. Commands can be:

- `manage`, used to manage runtime resources, such as grammar and queries. Use this command to fetch, compile, link
  and install resources.
- `query`, used to get information about the languages configuration, installed resources, etc.

### Managing resources

`ktsctl manage --help` will provide more than enough help for you to get started, but here’s some more:

- A typical one-liner to install a language is `ktsctl manage -fcil <LANG>`, or even simpler,
  `ktsctl manage -sl <LANG>`.
- `-f, --fetch` will make `ktsctl` fetch and download grammars and queries. You can decide to first fetch resources for
  a given language, and then call the other commands later without fetching anymore; or you can combine everything at
  once.
- `-c, --compile` compiles and link grammars.
- `-i, --install` installs grammars and queries into `$XDG_DATA_HOME/kak-tree-sitter`. The install path can change
  depending on the operating system (for instance, it might be `$HOME/Library/Application\ Support` for macOS).
- `-l, --lang <LANG>` is the name of the language to install.
- `-s, --sync` does all of the above for you, but allows to synchronize already installed languages, so it won’t try
  to reinstall / recompile already installed resources. Use this to update your configuration (i.e. the language pins
  get changed for instance).

> The list of language names you can installed can be found with the [info command](#getting-information).

For instance, to fetch, compile and install the grammar and queries for the Rust programming language:

```sh
ktsctl manage -fcil rust
```

Once a language is installed, you will probably eventually update `ktsctl`, and if you haven’t set a specific `pin` for
this language, you can benefit from the default shipped configuration updates by using the `--sync` flag:

```sh
ktsctl manage -sl rust
```

That command will fetch, install and re-compile if required. You can also use that command for the very first time too,
so it’s a nice one-liner for people who don’t care about only fetching or only compiling.

#### Installing all languages at once

A useful one-liner that you can use to install everything at once is to use the `-a, --all` flag:

```bash
ktsctl manage -fcia
```

#### Synchronizing everything

If there was one command you shourd remember, it’s this one:

```sh
ktsctl manage -sa
```

It calls `--sync` with `--all`. Basically, it will:

- Ensure all the languages from the configuration are cloned / fetched.
- If you don’t have a resource for one of them, the resource is fetched, compiled, installed.
- If you do, the resource is checked against the pinned version of the configuration. If it’s too old, a new version
  is fetched, compiled, etc.

### Getting information

The `query` command allows to get information about tree-sitter resources. As with `manage`, you can use `--help` to
know what you can do, but here are some useful commands:

- `ktsctl query -l rust` will provide information about a specific language (here Rust). It will print out various
  configuration options, as well as whether the grammar and queries are installed.
- `ktsctl query -a` will display a short summary for all available and recognized languages.

## By-passing `ktsctl` and using your own runtime resources

If you do not want to get into the rabbit hole of writing your own grammars and queries, you will most likely want to
reuse datasets from other projects, such as the GitHub repositories of the grammars themselves (for instance,
[tree-sitter-rust] for Rust), [Neovim] or [Helix].

Whatever you decide to use, you need to update your [user configuration](configuration.md) file according to the
languages, grammars and queries. **However**, as explained in the linked section, 99% of people will just be satisfied
with the default settings shipped with `kak-tree-sitter`’s `default-config.toml`, which you can find at the root of the
repository, [here](https://git.sr.ht/~hadronized/kak-tree-sitter/tree/master/item/kak-tree-sitter-config/default-config.toml).
That configuration file is shipped with the binary (`kak-tree-sitter`), so you do not need to copy it; just add what you
need!

# A note for release channels

Release channels ([AUR], [brew], etc.) have the right to ship the `default-config.toml` file (or any of their liking)
along with both binaries. It is highly recommended that they follow SemVer (if they bundle `kak-tree-sitter v0.4.3`,
they should be named `kak-tree-sitter-0.4.3` for instance). However, adding an extra number for the bump of the
`default-config.toml` could be a good idea (so `kak-tree-sitter-0.4.3-1`, `kak-tree-sitter-0.4.3-2`, etc.).
