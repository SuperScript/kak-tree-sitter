# Getting started

Welcome! If you are reading this page, it is likely it is the first time you
hear about this project. First and foremost, thank you for considering using
this project. This section will provide you with a bunch of explanations about
how the project is made, how it works, what you should expect and what you
should not.

## Prerequisites

As the name implies, this project bridges [tree-sitter] and [Kakoune]. You do
not have to know anything about the former, but obviously, you need to have
[Kakoune] installed. The rest is handled by this project.

## What is this?

This project bridges [tree-sitter] and [Kakoune] via a server, that can be run
on the CLI or inside [Kakoune] as a daemon. The server is unique to your
machine, so it doesn’t matter that you start it from several Kakoune sessions,
only one server will be up (this is implemented via a _PID file_). When the
server is up, it remains up until the last session exits (if started from within
Kakoune), or when you send it the `SIGINT` signal (_Ctrl-C_) if started on the
CLI.

When the server is started from Kakoune, it will install some commands and hooks
to be able to communicate with the server. The configuration allows to decide
which commands, hooks, user-modes etc. you want to have installed.

A running server will wait for a session to send requests, and will reply
asynchronously. That prevents your editor from freezing and allows the server to
maintain a state / view of your per-session buffers. Because it uses
[tree-sitter] under the hood, it will parse the content of your buffers as
_trees_, allowing for fast operations.

> Several features are supported / will be supported. You can refer to the
> [Features](features.md) document to know more about what you can do with the
> [tree-sitter] integration.

In order to work, the server requires some runtime resources to be around. This
project doesn’t ship with those resources, and you are free to use whichever
sources you want. Two main kind of resources are needed:

- _Grammars_, which are C dynamic libraries loaded at runtime by the server and
  used to parse your buffers and operate on trees.
- _Queries_, which are [scm] strings allowing to _query_ parsed trees with a
  Lisp-like syntax. We use those to, mostly, unify the type of queries to all
  languages/grammars, such as highlighting, text-objects, indents, etc.

You can either find those resources yourself, or use the provided controller
companion of the server that provides that for free for you. See the
[ktsctl](ktsctl.md) document.

## What you should expect

The project was made in a way that supports most of the features that are
natively available in other editors regarding [tree-sitter], such as [Helix]. It
tries to be frustration-free, shipping with a default sane configuration; you
should — and will probably — never modify the configuration, but if you need to,
you can. The server and the [Kakoune] side of the project is made in a way that
puts performance at top priority. Because we are using a UNIX approach, we try
to minimize as much as possible process starts, memory writes, etc., approaching
as near as possible memory-to-memory communication. Finally, the controller
should do everything for you, provided you instruct what you want. You are not
required to know _anything_ about [tree-sitter], nor how a query works or even
how to compile a grammar. We do that for you. Just focus on what’s important;
your own projects.

## What you should not expect

The server is mostly about _transformations_. It doesn’t ship with _data_.
Hence, you will not get grammars and queries shipped with the binary by default.
It is important that you understand that; it works out of the box, but you still
need to tell it what you want at first.

Colorschemes support is hard. Using this project won’t automatically make your
colorscheme look super nice. You will have to adapt or use a new,
[tree-sitter]-powered colorscheme. The community tries its best to provide more
and more colorschemes. You shall want to visit the
[Highlighting](highlighting.md) document for further information.
