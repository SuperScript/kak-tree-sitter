# How to install

The project contains two binaries:

- `kak-tree-sitter`, which contains both the UNIX server and client.
- `ktsctl`, the CLI controller. It is used to install various runtime resources
  related to `kak-tree-sitter`, such as grammars and queries. It is **optional**
  and you can install all the required resources manually if youâ€™d rather like.

Depending on your operating system, you should target a _release channel_ and a
package manager to use.

Additionally, completions are available for some shells. Feel free to visit
the [completion](completions.md) document for installation.

- [crates.io](#crates-io)

## crates.io

This is the initial way of installing the project, and should only be used if
you have no other option.

```sh
cargo install kak-tree-sitter
cargo install ktsctl
```

Once you have installed the server and the optional controller, go on reading
